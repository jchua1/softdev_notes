Aim: Defeating the trojans with the help of ajax

AJAX
	Asynchronus Javascript And Xml
	
	System created to send data to a server in the background of a page without having to reload the page or wait for the server to acknolwedge the change.
	
	It is a combination of technologies including javascript, html, DOM, and XML.
	
	AJAX calls can send data to a server using GET or POST (for example), and then catch the data sent by the server in response.
	
	Originally, XML was the only supported format for sending/receiving data, but now many formats are used, including JSON and plain text.
	
	Using jquery for AJAX
	
		The jquery library provides clean wrapper functions for making AJAX calls.
		
		$.ajax(<SETTINGS>);
		
			Settings is an associative array containing all the information required to make the given ajax call.
			
			Notable settings keys:
			
				url: Server target link
				
				type: Method ("POST" or "GET")
				
				data: Data to be sent
				
				success: Function to be called if the server responds
				
					This function can take an argument if the server sends data in response.
					
				$.ajax ({
					url: '/foo',
					type: 'GET',
					data: "look it's information!",
					success: function(d) {
						console.log(d);
					}
				});
				
			jquery also has $.get() and $.post() wrappers.
			
				$.get(<url>, <callback function>);
				
				$.get("/foo", function(d) {
					console.log(d);
				});
