Do Now: What are your problems with SQL/relational DBs?

Drawbacks of a SQL database
- fixed schema, must be known ahead of time
- lists problematic
- redundant data (in a bad way)
- must live on a single host

Alternative to relational, schema-oriented db:
	document-oriented DB
	
Doc-oriented DB:
- record stored as a doc instead of a row in a table
- each doc contains all data associated with given record as key-value pairs ("fields")
- fields need no type specification
- a field may contain different types of data
	eg, lists, dicts, etc.
- docs may be grouped together in a collection (roughly equivalent to a relDB table)
- docs in a collection need NOT have same complement of fields
- each doc gets primary key, usually assigned by DB manager

NoSQL
- not-only SQL

mongo
- requires server
- allows distribution of databases over many hosts
