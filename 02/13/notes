HTML5
Redesign of HTML with focus on accessing modern web browser features

- Designed around JS and a standardized DOM
- Includes built-in suppot for audio and video playback
- Inlcudes and element that can be directly drawn on

Canvas
HTML5 element that provides a drawing area

- JS functions can draw on a canvas element
- You must declare what context you are drawing in
	E.g. 2D drawing, 3D drawing, raw bitmap rendering...
	
Basic canvas operation:

HTML:
<canvas height="500" width="500" id="slate">
</canvas>

JS:
var c = document.getElementById('slate');
var ctx = c.getContext('2d');

ctx.fillStyle = '##ff0000';
ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 200);
