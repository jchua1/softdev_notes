Aim: Connect the Dots

Do Now: Reboot, login, load last hw in editor and browser

Use a path to draw arbitrary shapes, including circles and curves

- A context can keep track of one path at a time
- The path is not drawn until stroke() is called
- A path is considered done when a new beginPath() is called

beginPath()
	Starts or resets current path
	
moveTo(x, y)
	Moves path to position (x, y)
	Does not result in a line or a filled in section
	
lineTo(x, y)
	Moves path to position (x, y)
	will result in a line and a filled in section
	
closePath()
	Results in a line from current position to start pos
	Path can be continued after
	
stroke()
	Renders all the lines in the path, does not end the path
	
fill()
	Fills the interior of the path
	Will not work if the path has fewer than 3 points in it.
	
ctx.fillText("str", x, y)
