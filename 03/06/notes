Aim: Bubble, bubble, js and trouble

Do Now:
Create an HTML+JS program with the following features:
* HTML file with an svg element and a "clear" button
* JS fxn that will create and return a circle svg element
* JS fxn that will call fxn above, then add the returned circle to the svg element
* Attach this draw-circle fxn to the svg element
* JS fxn that will clear an svg element
* Attach the clear function to the clear button

JS event propagation

target: deepest element (in DOM tree) which triggered an event
	
Events initially propagate downward from the topmost node in the DOM tree to the target element.
This is known as event capturing.

After an event reaches its target, it then propagates back up the DOM tree.
This is known as event bubbling.

By default, event listeners do not trigger until the event bubbling phase.

To trigger events at the capture phase, add true as third arg to addEventListener

	x.addEventListener("click", foo, true)
	
To cancel event propagation:
	e.stopPropagation();
