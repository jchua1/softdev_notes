Aim: Lists, comprende?

LIST COMPREHENSION:
syntactic sugar to transform list-processing loops into something resembling mathematical set notation.

A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a FOR clause, then zero or more FOR or IF clauses.

The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the FOR and IF clauses which follow it.

Ternary Operator
x if BOOLEXP else y
-a if a < 0 else a
