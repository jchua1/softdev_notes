Aim: Close it Down

A CLOSURE is a function that refers to independent variables, such that the function defined in the closure "remembers" the environment in which it was created.

or

A CLOSURE is the scope available to a function at the time of its definition.

Python allows you to define a function within a function.

As in Scheme, Python can use lambda to create a function literal without a name (an 'anonymous function').

This command creates a closure, by binding variables:
b = h(1)

Now for a non-anonymous function within a function:
def f(x):
	def g(y):
		return x + y
	return g
