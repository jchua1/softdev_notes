in a closure...
A function is declared inside another function
The inner function accesses a variable from the outer function (outside of the local scope of the inner function)
The external function binds a value to the variable and finish (or closes) before the inner function can be completed

A Python decorator encapsulates a closure

A python decorator allows you to transparently wrap functionality
