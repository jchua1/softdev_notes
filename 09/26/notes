- Import other python files to make code more compact
- Shouldn't write free floating code in flask app because you can run into potential -issues
- Related to hw: job chosen when server is started so it picks the same job every -single time you refresh
- Can put global variables at the top of the file (split dictionary once)
- Attaching code to functions makes code modular
- One directory per flask application
- Importing other python files: from utils import <python file>
- To import properly: touch utils/__init__.py <-- to make directories into modules


Example Flask Organization
	flask-app/
		app.py	    the actual flask application
		templates/  all your templates
		utils/      extra python modules
		data/	    data files
