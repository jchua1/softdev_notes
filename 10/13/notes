Aim: All your data are belong to us.

Relational database

	Database that stores information as a collection of tables.

	Field: Column data in a RDB
	
	Record: Row in a RDB

	Data can be linked between tables based on field values.

SQL (Structured Query Language)
	
	Standard language designed to work with relational databases.

	Is used for any major db programs, though the implementations may not (mostly are not) compatible.

	MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle are different SQL implementations.

SQLite

	SQL implementation that relies entirely on function calls in the parent program. There is no database server. (No background process).

	All database information is stored in a single file.

	Data is dynamically typed as values are inserted into a table. (Fields have preferences, but don't require that type).

Basic SQLite Operations

	CREATE TABLE

		Add a table to a database

		CREATE TABLE <name> (<column name> <data type>, ...)

			The data type will help to convert entered values to a suggested type.

			TEXT, INTEGER, REAL, NUMERIC, BLOB

				NUMERIC will default to an integer, but can be a floating point

				BLOB means no suggested type.
				
			Columns can be given a PRIMARY KEY attribute, denoting that every entry in that column is unqie and cannot be NULL.
			
			Columns can be given a NOT NULL attribute, denoting that no entry can be NULL.
			
			.tables shows all your tables.
			
		INSERT INTO
				
				Insert a record into a table.
				
				INSERT INTO <name> VALUES ( <field 1>, <field 2> ...)
				
					Will add a record to a table matching the values to the columns in order.
					
					NULL can be used in any entry.
					
		SELECT * FROM <name>;
			Shows all entries in a table.
